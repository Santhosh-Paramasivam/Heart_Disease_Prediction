# Heart Disease Prediction

Created : June 2023
Uploaded to Github : October 2024

This repo contains :
  - Executable of the Python app for Windows
  - Stripped-down machine learning code
  - Python code for the application

The code for a Python application created using the Tkinter GUI Framework.
It uses a logistic regression machine learning model to calculate the probability of a person having heart disease from 11 body metrics.

The metrics are as follows :
  - Age
  - Sex
  - ChestPainType
  - RestingBP (Resting Blood Pressure)
  - Cholesterol 
  - FastingBS (Fasting Blood Sugar)
  - RestingECG 
  - MaxHR (Max Heart Rate)
  - ExerciseAngina
  - Oldpeak
  - ST_Slope

Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-learn packages were used in a Jupyter Notebook environment to train the machine learning model.
